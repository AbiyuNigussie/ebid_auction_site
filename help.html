                  Please note your existing subscription will continue until its

                </h3>
                <p>
                  If you have a GOLD account and cannot see the "Stop My
                  Subscription" option in the dropdown menu on the "My eBid > My
                  Subscription" page, the most likely reason is that eBid do not
                  hold a card reference against your account and therefore we
                  are unable to rollover your subscription or collect
                  outstanding fees. Your last subscription may have already
                  expired. You can check your last subscription expiry at the
                  bottom on the "My Subscription" page. To rectify the problem
                  update your registered card using the link provided on the "My
                  Subscription" page. If you do not wish to continue with a GOLD
                  subscription, we suggest changing your subscription to SILVER,
                  which does not incur subscription fees.

                  receive email at the address you provide to us. It's our way
                  of authenticating your registration. By doing this, we avoid
                  problems of incorrect email addresses preventing a deal from
                  happening, and of people registering other people without
                  their knowledge and placing bids on their behalf.

                <p>
                  When you first register you choose your own password. It can
                  be changed on the "My eBid" > "My Personal Details" page.

                  If your username and password don't seem to be working,
                  firstly check you are entering it correctly, you'll be amazed
                  how many people mistake a small "L" for a capital "i" or have
                  an incorrect computer clock. Secondly you can visit our
                  reminder page where you can enter your username or email
                  address and be sent a password reset link by email to your
                  registered email address. The email you receive will identify
                  the IP address of the person who requested the reset. You can
                  find your IP address here if you wish to confirm it came from
                  you.

                <p>
                  Logging into the eBid Forums area is done using the same
                  username and password you use for the main eBid site. If you
                  don't seem to be able to login this could be due to you
                  updating your password at the Forums site without realising.
                  This option has now been removed. Just visit the "My Personal
                  Details" page of My eBid to change your password, this will
                  update your details for the main site as well as the eBid
                  Forums area.
